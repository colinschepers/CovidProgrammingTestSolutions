# Covid Programming Test with Solutions

## Problem statement
We are having performance issues with the search engine.

## Description
Running the console app will load in the data from a csv file, initialize an engine instance and run a few search queries, printing out the results in the console. The only changes you have to make are in the Engine class. 

## Solutions
This repository also contains possible solutions to optimize the engine. Five different implementations show how you can remove complexity from the initial engine implementation. The class description explains what improvement is done and how it changes the time complexity. Run the solutions console app to automatically run the search queries for each engine, showing their individual running time.
